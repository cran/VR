- profile.glm will report inadequate supplied glm fits, not just fail.
- new method confint.lm.
- fractions/rational allow missing values.
- mvrnorm has an `empirical' argument.
- predict.lda and predict.qda try harder to avoid exponential underflow.

- new function fitdistr for ML estimation of univariate distributions.
- new function glmmPQL to use lme to fit GLMMs by PQL
- truehist allows rule for nbins to be specified as a character string.
- parcoord function.
- new datasets bacteria, epil, nlschools, SP500


Library class
-------------

- fixed a bug in knn(use.all = F)
- SOM, batchSOM and ancilliary functions.


Library nnet
------------

- no copying of datasets even in R.
- model.frame method for multinom (even in R).


Library spatial
