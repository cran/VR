This file documents software changes since the second edition
=============================================================


Version 5.1 (Jul 1997) was the software release for the second edition.
Version 5.2 (Jan 1998) mainly differed in explicit copyright claims.
Version 5.3 (Mar 1998) has rewritten nnet code to use less memory and 
  to use double precision for all internal calculations. This may lead
  to a different local minimum being found.  Separate version for 
  S-PLUS 5.0 (Dec 1998).

Version 6.0 (Jan 1999) pre-release for the third edition, adds ppr and lqs, 
  addterm, dropterm, enhanced rlm and stepAIC. Support for S-PLUS 5.x.

Version 6.1 (Apr 1999) release for the third edition. Support for S-PLUS
  5.1 and 2000, added more na-handling.

Version 6.2 (Aug 2000) tidy up documentation.  Would be 6.1pl010, but that
  causes R problems.
  (Oct 2000) support for S-PLUS 6.0 for Unix.


The na-handling methods of S-PLUS 2000 have been incorporated. With most
fitting methods, if na.action=na.exclude then the fitted values, residuals
and predictions (without newdata) are filled with NAs. For ppr, multinom 
and nnet, predictions with newdata are also filled with NAs.

In earlier versions of S-PLUS na.exclude is not available. There is one
change: if library MASS is attached ahead of survival4/5 and na.omit is used, 
residuals will no longer be filled with NAs (this is the behaviour of S-PLUS
2000).

The improved prediction methods of S-PLUS 2000 (that we supplied) are
incorporated, for that version only, so prediction involving factor
variables will be safer.


Library MASS
------------

- Revised biplot method for PCA, and a method for correspondence analysis.
- plot and pairs methods for lda fits.
- deriv/deriv3 will handle gamma, lgamma and digamma.
- cross-validation methods for lda, qda and predict.qda.
- corrected predict.glm to handle known dispersion.

- enhanced stepAIC with fast code for linear least-squares methods, 
  use.start argument and option to change the penalty factor in AIC.
- addterm and dropterm to replace add1 and drop1, with added features 
  and default methods.
- lqs for lmsreg, ltsreg and S-estimation.
- enhanced rlm, including MM-estimation. The old rlm is available as orlm
  for backward compatibility.
- ppr for projection pursuit regression (formerly in a separate library, 
  now in double precision). predict.ppr handles NAs in newdata.
- loglm now works with addterm, dropterm, stepAIC.
- polr for proportional odds logistic regression.
- functions lm.gls and lm.ridge from the on-line answers.
- max.col transferred from nnet allows missing values.

- new datasets anorexia, cabbages, eagles, housing, muscle, whiteside.
- dataset Insurance has informative levels.

- eqscplot has new arguments ratio and uin.
- stepAIC will not drop strata terms in coxph or survreg models.
- profile.glm will report inadequate supplied glm fits, not just fail.
- new method confint.lm.
- fractions/rational allow missing values.
- stepAIC/addterm/dropterm now work with survReg as well as survreg fits.
- mvrnorm was an `empirical' argument


Library nnet
------------

- `censored' argument for nnet.
- no hard limits on the net size -- but see argument MaxNWts.
- acctol and reltol are now user-settable arguments.
- internal calculations are now entirely in double precision.
- vcov.multinom now uses a generalized inverse for singular fits.
- classes nnet and multinom now have residuals component.
- anova, deviance and residuals methods.
- at least 2 decimal places when printing deviance and AIC.
- predict methods allow missing values in newdata.
- max.col moved to MASS.
- no copying of datasets even in R.


Library spatial
---------------

- No limit on nx in surf.gls. Large interpolation tables are no longer
  stored in the object but re-created when needed, so the objects are
  smaller.


Library treefix
---------------

A more general version of the replacement code for prune.tree,
predict.tree and na.replace.tree supplied to StatSci for S-PLUS 3.4
and later.  This version is incorporated in S-PLUS 2000 and 5.1.

- prune.tree/prune.misclass will now use losses as well as the number
  of misclassifications.
