Robust Fitting of Linear Models
}
\description{
Fit a linear model by robust regression using an M estimator.
}
\usage{
rlm(x, \dots)
rlm.formula(formula, data, weights, \dots, subset, na.action = na.fail,
            method = c("M", "MM", "model.frame"),
            wt.method = c("case", "inv.var"),
            model = TRUE, x = TRUE, y = FALSE, contrasts=NULL)
rlm.default(x, y, weights, \dots, w = rep(1, nrow(x)),
            init, psi = psi.huber,
            method = c("M", "MM"), wt.method = c("case", "inv.var")
            scale.est, k2 = 1.345, maxit = 20, acc = 1e-4,
            test.vec = "resid")
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
a formula of the form \code{y ~ x1 + x2 + \dots{}}.
}
\item{data}{
data frame from which variables specified in \code{formula} are
preferentially to be taken.
}
\item{weights}{
prior weights for each case.
}
\item{subset}{
An index vector specifying the cases to be used in
fitting.
}
\item{na.action}{
A function to specify the action to be taken if \code{NA}s are found. The
default action is for the procedure to fail. An alternative is
\code{na.omit}, which leads to omission of cases with missing values on any
required variable.
}
\item{x}{
a matrix or data frame containing the explanatory variables.
}
\item{y}{
the response: a vector of length the number of rows of \code{x}.
}
\item{method}{
currently either M-estimation or find the model frame. MM estimation
is M-estimation with Tukey's biweight initialized by a specific
S-estimator. See the details section.
}
\item{wt.method}{
are the weights case weights (giving the relative importance of case,
so a weight of 2 means there are two of these) or the inverse of the
variances, so a weight of two means this error is twice as variable?
}
\item{w}{
(optional) initial down-weighting for each case.
}
\item{init}{
(optional) initial values for the coefficients OR a method to find
initial values OR the result of a fit with a \code{coef} component. Known
methods are \code{"ls"} (the default) for an initial least-squares fit
using weights \code{w*weights}, and \code{"lqs"} for an unweighted least-trimmed
squares fit with 200 samples.
}
\item{psi}{
the psi function is specified by this argument. It must give
(possibly by name) a function \code{g(x, \dots{}, deriv)} that for \code{deriv=0}
returns psi(x)/x and for \code{deriv=1} returns psi'(x). Tuning constants
will be passed in via \code{\dots{}}.
}
\item{scale.est}{
method of scale estimation: re-scaled MAD of the residuals or Huber's
proposal 2.
}
\item{k2}{
tuning constant used for Huber proposal 2 scale estimation.
}
\item{maxit}{
the limit on the number of IWLS iterations.
}
\item{acc}{
the accuracy for the stopping criterion.
}
\item{test.vec}{
the stopping criterion is based on changes in this vector.
}
\item{...}{
additional arguments to be passed to \code{rlm.default} or to the \code{psi}
function.
}}
\value{
An object of class \code{"rlm"} inheriting from \code{"lm"}.
The additional components not in an \code{lm} object are

\item{s}{
the robust scale estimate used
}
\item{w}{
the weights used in the IWLS process
}
\item{psi}{
the psi function with parameters substituted
}
\item{conv}{
the convergence criteria at each iteration
}
\item{converged}{
did the IWLS converge?
}}
\details{
  Fitting is done by iterated re-weighted least squares (IWLS).


  Psi functions are supplied for the Huber, Hampel and Tukey bisquare
  proposals as \code{psi.huber}, \code{psi.hampel} and
  \code{psi.bisquare}. Huber's corresponds to a convex optimization
  problem and gives a unique solution (up to collinearity). The other
  two will have multiple local minima, and a good starting point is
  desirable.


  Selecting \code{method = "MM"} selects a specific set of options which
  ensures that the estimator has a high breakdown point. The initial set
  of coefficients and the final scale are selected by an S-estimator
  with \code{k0 = 1.548}; this gives (for n >> p) breakdown point 0.5.
  The final estimator is an M-estimator with Tukey's biweight and fixed
  scale that will inherit this breakdown point provided \code{c > k0};
  this is true for the default value of \code{c} that corresponds to
  95\% relative efficiency at the normal.
