\title{
Blood Pressure in Rabbits
}
\description{
Five rabbits were studied on two occasions, after treatment with
saline (control) and after treatment with the \eqn{5-HT_3} antagonist MDL
72222.  After each treatment ascending doses of phenylbiguanide were
injected intravenously at 10 minute intervals and the responses of
mean blood pressure measured.  The goal was to test whether the
cardiogenic chemoreflex elicited by phenylbiguanide depends on the
activation of \eqn{5-HT_3} receptors.
