\title{
House Insulation: Whiteside's Data
}
\description{
Mr Derek Whiteside of the UK Building Research Station recorded the
weekly gas consumption and average external temperature at his own
house in south-east England for 26 weeks before, and 30 weeks after
cavity-wall insulation was installed. The object of the exercise was
to assess the effect of the insulation on gas consumption.
}
\format{
The \code{whiteside} data frame has 56 rows and 3 columns.:
}
\arguments{
\item{Insul}{
A factor, before or after insulation.
}
\item{Temp}{
Purportedly the average outside temperature in degrees Celsius. (These
values is far too low for any 56-week period in the 1960s in
South-East England. It might be the weekly average of daily minima.)
}
\item{Gas}{
The weekly gas consumption in 1000s of cubic feet.
