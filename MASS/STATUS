All the data sets are available, except faithful and tree which are
already in R.

Additional datasets to work our examples are:

VA, geyser, heart


moved to base R:
max.col		find largest column for each row of a matrix,
		breaking ties at random
digamma, trigamma	first and second derivatives of log Gamma
		(even of complex argument).

IQR, mosaicplot, relevel are in base R
lqs, cov.rob are in package lqs in R
biplot.princomp is in package mva in R
ppr is in package modreg in R
cpgram is in package ts in R

The following depend on facilities not in R and so do not work:

Choleski	Choleski decompositions for Matrices
histplot	Trellis histogram plots
vcov.nlregb	vcov methods for nlregb objects
vcov.nlminb	vcov methods for nlminb objects
